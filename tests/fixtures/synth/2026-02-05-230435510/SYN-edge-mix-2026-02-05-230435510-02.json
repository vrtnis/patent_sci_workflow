      "description_text": "An edge node may receive heterogeneous messages from sensors, applications, or gateways and forward the messages to a downstream consumer such as a broker or analytics service. In some implementations, the edge node performs normalization and lane assignment to reduce jitter and to improve throughput under variable load. The edge node can maintain multiple processing lanes, each lane having an independent queue and a worker that applies a selected normalization routine.\n\nA procedure may be executed as follows: first, ingest a message stream and parse a metadata header to obtain a topic identifier and a latency hint; next, compute a lane score from recent queue depth and select a lane; then, apply a normalization routine to the payload and emit a transformed message. In parallel, an audit record may be written to a local store, and a cache may retain some transformed messages for later replay. In some cases, the cache is replayed after a reconnect event, and the replay can be performed in batches of 50-500 messages."

      "description_text": "The normalization routine can include tokenization, field mapping, and compact representation generation. Tokenization may split the payload into fields based on delimiters, and field mapping may map at least one field to a canonical label set. The compact representation may be produced in multiple passes, and a pass count may be selected based on an observed error metric.\n\nOperationally, the edge node may periodically sample a subset of messages, estimate an error metric, and switch routines when the error metric exceeds a threshold. A workflow step can be interpreted as: open a connection, send a test batch, and confirm receipt before enabling replay. The audit record may store a hash and timestamp for each transformed message, and the local store may be rotated when a storage watermark is exceeded."
