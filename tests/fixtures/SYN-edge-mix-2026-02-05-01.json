      "description_text": "A distributed sensing deployment may include many field devices that produce time-series frames such as vibration samples, acoustic samples, or electrical measurements. An edge gateway can be positioned near the field devices to reduce backhaul usage while still enabling centralized analytics. In some implementations, the gateway receives frames, groups them into windows, and computes features that are suitable for a compact model. The gateway may decide, for each window, whether to run inference locally or to forward a reduced representation to a remote service. A technician can follow a workflow step: open the gateway console, select a device group, and press \"Start capture\" to begin streaming frames into the windowing pipeline.\n\nIn one procedure, the gateway maintains a policy table that maps a link quality value and a device class to an action. The link quality value can be derived from network measurements such as round trip time, packet loss, and jitter, and can be updated periodically. When the policy table indicates local inference, the gateway executes a compact model and writes an audit record containing an event label and a confidence score. When the policy table indicates remote inference, the gateway forms a sketch by retaining a subset of coefficients and transmits the sketch to the remote service, which returns an event label. The gateway can buffer windows in a priority queue so that urgent windows are drained earlier than less urgent windows, and the queue depth may be adjusted during operation.\n\nTo support auditing and troubleshooting, the audit record may include a device identifier, a window identifier, and a short explanation string. In some cases, the gateway normalizes samples by a scale factor and applies a smoothing kernel before feature extraction. The smoothing kernel width may be selected from 3 to 17, and a user may choose a different width for different device groups. The system may also apply a band selection such as 10 Hz to 2.5 kHz when forming the sketch, although other bands can be used. In certain deployments, the gateway uses a queue depth of 2 to 12 and a threshold of 0.6 for selecting local inference, while other deployments use different values."
