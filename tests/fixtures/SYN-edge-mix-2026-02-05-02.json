A computer-implemented method for mixed edge processing of sensor events, the method comprising: (a) receiving, at an edge node, a stream of event records from one or more sensors, each event record including a timestamp and a payload; (b) partitioning the stream into windows of 50 ms to 2 s and generating, for each window, a feature vector including at least a count and a dispersion value; (c) selecting, using a policy table, whether to execute an inference model locally or to forward the feature vector to a remote service; (d) when executing locally, producing a classification label and an uncertainty score; (e) when forwarding, transmitting the feature vector and receiving a remote classification label; and (f) emitting an action message to a downstream controller when the classification label satisfies a threshold, wherein the threshold is between 0.2 and 0.9.",

      "description_text": "The disclosure relates to mixed edge and remote processing of sensor-derived events. In an example deployment, an edge node receives event records from multiple sensors, groups the event records into time windows, and computes features used for classification. A policy table controls whether inference is executed locally or forwarded to a remote service, and the policy table may be updated based on observed latency, error, or resource usage. In one procedure, the system performs: collect events, compute features, choose execution location, run inference, and emit an action message to a controller.\n\nA representative implementation may include a cache for model artifacts and a mechanism for switching model versions. The edge node can store some event records for later audit, and can transmit summaries rather than raw payloads. In a coordination procedure across multiple edge nodes, a heartbeat is broadcast, a leader is elected, and sensor assignments are distributed; if a heartbeat is missed, a reassignment is triggered and a node is instructed to fetch configuration, apply the configuration, and then begin processing. The policy may specify window sizes from 50 ms to 2 s, model artifact sizes from 2 MB to 200 MB, and a switching count N of 3 to 12 windows, while other values may be left open for tuning such as storing records for 7 to 90 and treating a missed-heartbeat count of 2 to 6 as sufficient."

      "description_text": "In some embodiments, the feature computation includes a normalized energy value derived from a fixed number of samples and a dispersion value derived from the payload distribution. The system may apply ambiguous quantifiers in policy rules, for example assigning each sensor to at most a few edge nodes, or storing at least some event records when bandwidth is limited. A workflow can be implemented as a sequence of steps executed by a task runner: obtain the latest policy table, validate a model artifact, process windows, and publish action messages to a downstream controller.\n\nProcedurally, an edge node can execute (a) receive event records, (b) partition into windows, (c) compute features, (d) decide local versus remote inference, (e) generate a label and uncertainty, and (f) log results and optionally store event records. If remote inference is selected, the edge node transmits the feature vector and receives a remote label, then continues processing subsequent windows. In a failure scenario, the leader node can reassign sensors and instruct a replacement node to fetch configuration, apply the configuration, and begin processing within a target time, while leaving some parameters unspecified for later configuration such as 2 to 6 and 7 to 90."
