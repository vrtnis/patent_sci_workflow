      "description_text": "Field and overview. This disclosure relates to processing sensor events at an edge node and mixing the events into mixed records for upstream consumption. In some deployments, sensors produce partially redundant payloads with inconsistent timing, and the edge node performs binning, mixing, and emission to reduce bandwidth while preserving salient signals. The edge node may be a gateway, a microcontroller, or a containerized service executing on a local compute device.\n\nProcedure. In an example procedure, the edge node receives event records from multiple sensors and normalizes timestamps into a local timeline. The node assigns each event record to a mixing bin using a hash of a payload portion and a time window, and then computes a mixed record for each bin using a selected weighted operator. Next, the node emits the mixed record to an upstream service and stores a provenance tuple in a local cache; then the node repeats the procedure for subsequent event records. A sentence that can be interpreted as a workflow step is: open the bin, mix the payloads, and forward the result.\n\nOperator selection and thresholds. The weighted operator can be selected based on a stability metric computed over a trailing window of samples. When the stability metric indicates instability, the node may choose a conservative operator such as median or majority vote. The node may compute an ambiguity score from disagreement, recency, and missingness, and may emit a mixed record when the ambiguity score exceeds a threshold or when a bin accumulates a certain number of event records.\n\nLogging and restart behavior. The node can write provenance tuples to a log file and rotate the log file after a configured amount. Upon restart, the node can rehydrate the local cache from the log file and resume binning and mixing without requiring upstream state. In some cases, the node delays emission for a short interval to allow late-arriving sensor events to be included in the same mixing bin."
